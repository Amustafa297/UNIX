                    UNIX comes in a variety of variations, but they all have some things in common. Sun Solaris,
                    GNU/Linux, and MacOS X are the most popular UNIX variants. Linux, on the other hand, is packaged as
                    a Linux distribution. There are a number of Linux distributions available, both free and paid.

                    The GNU Project began in 1984 with the goal of creating the GNU system, a complete UNIX-like
                    operating system that is free software. GNU/Linux systems are variants of the GNU operating system
                    that use the Linux kernel. Though these systems are commonly referred to as "Linux," they are more
                    appropriately referred to as GNU/Linux systems.

                    Mac OS X is a Unix-based graphical operating system based on technologies developed at NeXT (from
                    the second half of the 1980s to Apple's purchase of the company in late 1996), as well as
                    technologies from Apple's "classic" OS and FreeBSD. Every iteration of Mac OS X for Intel processors
                    since its sixth release, Mac OS X 10.5.0 "LeopaArd," has received UNIX 03 certification. <br>
