          <p>
            The broad scope of Unix Shell Scripting is one of the main reasons
            for its popularity. It's a strong programming technique that can
            help you improve your command-line skills, save time, and eliminate
            time-consuming file management responsibilities.

            Whereas the demand for Unix shell programming skills continues to
            grow, there is still a scarcity of experienced experts on the
            market. Developers and systems administrators that are proficient in
            Unix Shell Scripting have limitless prospects for improvement. Some
            job roles using UNIX skills: <br />
            a) Systems Engineer-UNIX <br />
            b) Software Engineer <br />
            c) UNIX Engineer job <br />

          <h1>Difference between UNIX and Windows</h1>
          <p>
            Since most of the people are using and are used to Windows operating
            system here are some of the main differences between UNIX and
            Windows. <br />
            1. UNIX uses Command Line Interface while Windows uses Graphical
            User Interface (GUI). <br />
            2. UNIX allows multiprocessing while Windows does not. <br />
            3. UNIX is command-based operating system and windows is menu based.
            <br />
            4. Although Windows has improved greatly its stability UNIX is still
            superior in this context. <br />
            5. In UNIX users can save two files with the same name while that is
            not possible in Windows operating systems. <br />
